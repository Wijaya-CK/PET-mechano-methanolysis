# PET-mechano-methanolysis

This repository contains supplementary files to the paper "Mechanocatalytic Methanolysis of Polyethylene Terephthalate". The files available consists of:

1) All_structures folder : Q-Chem frequency calculation outputs from the optimized coordinates of each chemical species reported in the paper. Do note the files are named as state_compund-name, which both can be found in the first and second column of table S3.
2) Example_set folder : Q-Chem sample input and output files of 1) optimization and frequency calculation of a minima and a transition state (TS), and 2) intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC, forward and bacward directions) calculations of the latter.
